# Navigation
This is a simple app created in Android Studio using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. <br>
This app uses rememberNavController to navigate from Screen A to Screen B, and routes are established in a separate file to allow for easy screen name changes and prevent app from crashing if name is called incorrectly.
